# 180-Day-Full-Stack-JS-Challenge

# About This Challenge

>180 Days to Full Stack Developer" is a personal challenge I'm documenting publicly.

# The goal?
>To go from zero to full-stack developer in just 180 days — with no shortcuts.

>I’m using The Odin Project as my main roadmap, and learning everything from HTML/CSS to backend, databases, and deployment.

# Why I’m Doing This</h3>
>I don’t come from a CS background. I have no degree, no fancy bootcamp — just determination, a laptop, and internet.
>This challenge is part of my bigger 1837-day mission to become a Beast — mentally, physically, financially, and technically.
>I’m doing this to prove that consistent action over time beats talent, luck, and excuses.

# What You’ll Find Here

>Daily logs of what I learn.
>Projects I build along the way.
>Mistakes, bugs, and how I solve them.
>Resources, code, thoughts, and breakthroughs.
>Brutally honest updates (no filters).

** Whether you're a beginner like me or just curious — this is the raw, real journey of building in public.**
